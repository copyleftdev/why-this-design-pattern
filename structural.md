# Structural Design Patterns

1. **Adapter**:
   - Use Case: Adapter pattern is used when you need to make two incompatible interfaces work together. It allows objects with different interfaces to collaborate by providing a wrapper or adapter class that translates one interface into another.

2. **Bridge**:
   - Use Case: Bridge pattern is used when you want to decouple an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently. It is helpful when you have multiple implementations or variations of an abstraction and want to switch between them at runtime.

3. **Composite**:
   - Use Case: Composite pattern is used when you want to treat a group of objects as a single object. It allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures, representing part-whole hierarchies, and enables clients to treat individual objects and groups uniformly.

4. **Decorator**:
   - Use Case: Decorator pattern is used when you want to add behavior or modify the functionality of an object dynamically without changing its interface. It allows you to wrap an object with one or more decorators, providing additional features or responsibilities at runtime.

5. **Facade**:
   - Use Case: Facade pattern is used when you want to provide a simplified interface to a complex system or set of classes. It acts as a high-level interface that hides the complexities of the underlying system, providing a convenient and unified entry point for clients.

6. **Flyweight**:
   - Use Case: Flyweight pattern is used when you want to minimize memory usage by sharing common data across multiple objects. It is useful when you have a large number of similar objects that can share certain data, thus reducing memory overhead.

7. **Front Controller**:
   - Use Case: Front Controller pattern is used when you want to provide a centralized entry point or controller for handling requests in a web application or system. It helps in managing the flow of requests, handling common tasks, and providing a consistent request handling mechanism.

8. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**:
   - Use Case: MVC pattern is used when you want to separate the application's data (model), user interface (view), and the logic for handling user input and events (controller). It helps in achieving separation of concerns, enhancing modularity and maintainability.

9. **Proxy**:
   - Use Case: Proxy pattern is used when you want to control access to an object, add additional functionality, or provide a placeholder for an expensive or remote object. It allows you to create a surrogate or representative object that controls access to the real object and provides additional behaviors if needed.

These are some examples of the use cases for structural design patterns. The actual implementation and utilization of these patterns may vary depending on the specific requirements and architecture of your application.
