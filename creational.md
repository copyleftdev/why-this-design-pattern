# Creational Design Patterns

1. **Abstract Factory**:
   - Use Case: Abstract Factory pattern is used when you want to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. It provides an interface for creating objects of various types, allowing you to switch between different object implementations seamlessly.

2. **Borg**:
   - Use Case: Borg pattern, also known as Singleton with shared state, is used when you want to ensure that multiple instances of a class share the same state. It allows objects to share data while maintaining separate identities, typically used for managing global resources or configurations.

3. **Builder**:
   - Use Case: Builder pattern is used when you want to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. It provides a step-by-step approach to create objects, enabling the construction of objects with different configurations.

4. **Factory**:
   - Use Case: Factory pattern is used when you want to delegate the responsibility of creating objects to a factory method. It provides a centralized method to create objects, allowing for flexibility and decoupling between the client code and the actual object creation.

5. **Lazy Evaluation**:
   - Use Case: Lazy Evaluation pattern is used when you want to defer the evaluation or instantiation of an object until it is actually needed. It can be beneficial for improving performance and resource utilization in scenarios where object creation or computation is expensive.

6. **Pool**:
   - Use Case: Pool pattern is used when you want to manage a pool of reusable objects. It allows objects to be created and maintained in a pool, which can be acquired and released as needed, reducing the overhead of object creation and destruction.

7. **Prototype**:
   - Use Case: Prototype pattern is used when you want to create new objects by cloning existing ones, avoiding the need for explicit instantiation. It is useful when the creation process is complex or costly and can be optimized by cloning existing objects.

Please note that these are general descriptions of the design patterns and their top use cases. The actual implementation and use cases may vary depending on the specific requirements of your project.
