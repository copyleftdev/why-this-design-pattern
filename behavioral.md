# Behavioral Design Patterns

1. **Catalog Pattern**:
    - Use Case: Catalog Pattern is used when you need to provide a unified interface to access different types of objects in a collection. It allows you to retrieve objects based on their unique key or identifier.

2. **Chain of Responsibility**:
    - Use Case: Chain of Responsibility is used when you want to decouple the sender and receiver of a request. It allows multiple objects to handle a request in a chain until one of them processes it or passes it to the next object in the chain.

3. **Chaining Method**:
    - Use Case: Chaining Method, also known as Fluent Interface, is used when you want to provide a more readable and concise way of configuring or invoking multiple operations on an object. It allows method calls to be chained together, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

4. **Command**:
    - Use Case: Command pattern is used when you want to encapsulate a request as an object. It allows you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

5. **Iterator**:
    - Use Case: Iterator pattern is used when you want to provide a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying structure. It allows traversal of complex data structures such as lists, trees, or graphs.

6. **Mediator**:
    - Use Case: Mediator pattern is used when you want to define a central object that encapsulates the communication and coordination between multiple objects. It promotes loose coupling by preventing direct object-to-object interactions.

7. **Memento**:
    - Use Case: Memento pattern is used when you want to capture and restore an object's internal state without violating encapsulation. It allows you to save and restore the state of an object, providing undo or rollback functionality.

8. **Observer**:
    - Use Case: Observer pattern is used when you want to establish a one-to-many dependency between objects, where multiple observers are notified of any state changes in a subject object. It is commonly used in event-driven systems or to implement publish-subscribe mechanisms.

9. **Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub)**:
    - Use Case: Pub-Sub pattern is used when you want to establish a loosely coupled communication between message publishers and subscribers. Publishers send messages without knowledge of the subscribers, and subscribers express interest in specific types of messages.

10. **Registry**:
    - Use Case: Registry pattern is used when you want to provide a centralized registry or repository to store and retrieve objects by their key or identifier. It is commonly used in dependency injection frameworks or service locators.

11. **Specification**:
    - Use Case: Specification pattern is used when you want to encapsulate business rules or conditions as objects. It allows you to combine these specifications using logical operators to build complex rules and query criteria.

12. **State**:
    - Use Case: State pattern is used when you want to change the behavior of an object based on its internal state. It allows an object to alter its behavior dynamically by changing its internal state, encapsulating each state in a separate class.

13. **Strategy**:
    - Use Case: Strategy pattern is used when you want to define a family of interchangeable algorithms or behaviors and encapsulate them as objects. It allows you to select and use different algorithms at runtime, depending on the situation or context.

14. **Template**:
    - Use Case: Template pattern is used when you want to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm. It promotes code reuse while providing a framework for customization.

15. **Visitor**:
    - Use Case: Visitor pattern is used when you want to separate the algorithms or operations performed on a set of objects from their structure. It allows you to define new operations without modifying the objects themselves, promoting extensibility.

Please note that these are general descriptions of the design patterns and their common use cases. The actual implementation and use cases may vary depending on the specific requirements of your project.
